# RemitDEX Demo Script for ETHGlobal Hackathon

## üéØ The Problem (30 seconds)
"Traditional remittance services charge 7-10% fees and take 3-5 days. Even crypto solutions require complex multi-step processes. Workers lose billions annually just trying to send money home."

## üí° Our Solution: RemitDEX (30 seconds)
"RemitDEX lets users send money from ANY blockchain to ANY country in minutes, not days. We combine 1inch's DEX aggregation for best rates with Stellar's instant settlement and real anchor network for local delivery."

## üîß How It Works (1 minute)

### Step 1: Multi-Chain Input
"Users can start with stablecoins on Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, or any major chain. No need to bridge manually."

### Step 2: 1inch Aggregation  
"We use 1inch to find the absolute best rate across 300+ DEXes. This alone saves users 1-2% compared to using a single exchange."

### Step 3: Atomic Cross-Chain Swap
"Our HTLC bridge ensures atomic swaps - no bridge hacks possible. If anything fails, funds are automatically returned."

### Step 4: Stellar Settlement
"Stellar processes the transaction in 3-5 seconds with fees under $0.001. Compare that to Ethereum's minutes and dollars!"

### Step 5: Local Delivery
"Real Stellar anchors like Click (Philippines), Cowrie (Nigeria), and Vibrant (Argentina) deliver local currency directly to bank accounts or mobile wallets."

## üí≠ Q&A Prep

**Q: How is this different from existing crypto remittance?**
A: We're the only solution combining multi-chain input (via 1inch) with real fiat delivery (via Stellar anchors). Others make you manually bridge and find local off-ramps.

**Q: What about regulatory compliance?**
A: Built-in KYC/AML through anchor partnerships. SEP-12 compliant. Ready for real-world deployment.

**Q: Why not just use stablecoins?**
A: Recipients want local currency in their bank/mobile wallet, not USDC. We handle the complete end-to-end flow.

**Q: Revenue projections?**
A: At 0.3% of $700B market = $2.1B potential. Even 0.1% market share = $700M annually.
